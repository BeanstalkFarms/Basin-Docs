Oracles are a core piece of the decentralized financial tech stack. Non-network-native oracles that require additional trust assumptions beyond the integrity of the network are the only current option for Ethereum-native protocols in a post-Merge environment because current network-native oracles are not resistant to multi-block MEV manipulation.

**Multi Flow** is a multi-block MEV resistant network-native oracle for arbitrary current data in an EVM for both instantaneous and time-weighted values.

Check out the [Multi Flow whitepaper](https://basin.exchange/multi-flow-pump.pdf) for more information and complete formulas.
