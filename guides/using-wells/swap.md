# Swap

Tokens in Wells can be bought and sold on the [Swap](https://basin.exchange/#/swap) page. 

1. Make sure you are on [basin.exchange](https://basin.exchange/) and [connect your wallet](../basics/connect-wallet.md).
2. Navigate to the “Swap” page.
3. In the first field select the input token, or the asset you would like to sell. The dropdown menu will show each available input token and the total balance in your wallet.
4. In the second field, select the output token, or the asset you would like to buy.
5. Enter the amount of the input token to sell, up to the amount in your wallet.
6. Verify the amount of the output token you will receive in the output field.
8. A transaction preview will appear below the inputs. Select the “Minimum Output” dropdown to review each step of the transaction.
9. You may select a slippage tolerance by selecting the gear icon under "Minimum Output". The default slippage tolerance is 0.1%.
10. If you are trading ETH or have previously approved the token being spent, skip to Step 12. For all other tokens, select “Approve \[Token]”. This allows the Basin contract to spend the token, but does not execute the trade yet.
11. Confirm the approval transaction in your wallet, and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
12. Select “Swap”.
13. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
14. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, your tokens will be in your wallet.
