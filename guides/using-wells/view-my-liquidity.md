# View my Liquidity

1. Make sure you are on [basin.exchange](https://basin.exchange/) and [connect your wallet](../basics/connect-to-basin.md).
2. Navigate to the “Liquidity” page and select the "My Liquidity Positions" tab.
3. Your liquidity positions will be listed by Well.
   * By selecting the Well where you have LP tokens, you can view whether the LP tokens are [Deposited in the Silo](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/farm/silo) (if the Well is on the Deposit Whitelist) or [remove your liquidity](remove-liquidity.md).
