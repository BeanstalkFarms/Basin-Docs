# Basin

Basin is a composable EVM-native decentralized exchange protocol that allows for the composition of arbitrary exchange functions, network-native oracles and exchange implementations into a single liquidity pool known as a Well. In practice, Basin lowers the friction for market makers to deploy liquidity with custom orders and allows their liquidity to be used by other network-native protocols without additional trust assumptions.
